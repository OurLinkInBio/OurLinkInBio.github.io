    <h2>About!</h2>
    <p>M.A.R.V.I.S stands for, Medical Android for Rescue & Vital Intervention Services. And is to be a science fiction interpretation
      of what medical produces could potentially look like within the future. Whilst also being an immersive, interactive and simulating
      experience for players to enjoy. Within MARVIS, you portray a futuristic android who is apart of the Xelerii race.</p> <br>

    <h2>Friday 02nd May 2025</h2>
    <p> So a week has passed, since our first entry. Within this week some progress has infact been made in terms of project planning
      and physical development, so without further adue let's get into the log you've all been waiting for!
    </p> <br> <img src="../Images/Cover Image.png" alt="">
    <h3>Player Movement Mechanics</h3>
    <p>This is where the physical development has begun, with a simple yet intuative first person character controller, yes you read that
      right. A first person controller, does in fact mean first person movement, view and exploreation will be in first person. 
    </p> <br>
    <h3>Game Name Announcment</h3>
    <p>The main achievment from the past week, was figuring out the final name for the game. Which is a name the entire team has loved 
      since it's creation on "Thursday 1st May 2025" and the name is M.A.R.V.I.S, which stands for Medical Android for Rescue & Vital
      Intervention Services.
    </p> <br>
    <h3>More Ideas!</h3>
    <p>Yep. That's right. After wrapping up the last week, and the GGD & TDD we have in fact conjured up some more ideas which maybe fitting
      for a project of this magnitude, however the ideas may not make it into the final game as we might not have time. These are referred to as
      stretch goals, a goal which isn't necessary for the final project, but we would like in the game and inturn might perhaps end up as an update
      for the game at a later date. Also, with these new ideas come extra planning, preperations, GDD and TDD updates, so stay tuned for that.  
    </p> <br>
    <h3>Extra Announcment</h3>
    <p>By the end of next week "Friday 9th May 2025", we plan to begin releasing the video logs for this game. Should we begin development in time.
      Which we hope to have. 
    </p>

  <div class="devlog">
    <h2>Friday 25th April 2025</h2>
    <p>We have an idea! A simple and yet elegant idea which we plan to expand beyond it's limits to create a masterclass simulator for 
      all to enjoy, and we hope you can enjoy it as much as we are going to enjoy making it. But before development can actually begin, 
      we must first begin the planning preperations for the project. Starting with a term to refer to the game as, we can't just call it
      "game", or "the game". Can we? So, for the purpose of these logs, it is now known as "Project: NanoDrift", until a final name can 
      be selected.
    </p> <br>
    <h3>Game Idea</h3>
    <p>So, because we are worried of idea thiefs. We aim to keep the idea tight to the chest until we are approaching the release date of
      the game. Which for this project, we aim to have the game ready and done no later than end of 2027. I mean you maybe able to 
      decipher our project concept from things like features, mechanics, designs and drawings, but that's down to your own skills of research
      and deduction.
    </p> <br> 
    <h3>Game Design Document</h3>
    <p>Every game requires one of these. These documents, for those who aren't aware are for development teams to know the concept and the breakdown
      of game systems, a generalisation of features, mechanics, assets, sounds and more of what is mainly required for the game to function. 
      The game design document, otherwise known as a GDD was created fairly quickly and contains the base concept of the game, as well as some 
    minor and simplistic mechanics and features.</p> <br>
    <h3>Technical Design Document</h3>
    <p>The technical design document otherwise known as a TDD is more or less for the programmers and designers use, it allows the more technical side
      of the project development the ability to plan out how they would created the features and systems. 
    </p>
    <p>Our TDD is still in production and has not yet receach a standard to which we can start production with. We will keep you posted on this.</p>
